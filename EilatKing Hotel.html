    <p id="a">You'll find fun and laughter around every corner at the Isrotel King Solomon, where family always comes first. 
        Located on the shores of Eilat's idyllic North Beach Lagoon, the hotel is designed to provide the perfect family vacation in every way, all day long. 
        From the magical Kids' Kingdom to the huge swimming pool, or the many thrilling attractions nearby, there's always something to delight and amaze all ages.
        All of the Isrotel King Solomon's 415 suites and rooms include complementary Wi-Fi access, 
        as well as balconies with wonderful views of either the pool or the Edom Mountains.
        Guests who choose to stay on the uppermost "King's Floors" (10-12) are entitled to a range of exclusive benefits,
         including free access to the plush King's Lounge and its vast sun terrace, overlooking the Red Sea and the city of Eilat.
